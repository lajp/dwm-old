### DWM

This is my build of the great DWM window manager (Redundant acronym usage acknowledged)
For more information of DWM check [suckless' website](https://dwm.suckless.org)

Feel free to clone this repository and make your own custom DWM build based on it

For information on my configuration check out the [keybindings file](./keybindings.md)
I have also included my configuration of the [slstatus bar](https://tools.suckless.org/slstatus/) and some miscellaneous scripts I frequently use

The original dwm README can be found [here](./README.orig)
